# Transcription Tool
This module is a LMS-based digital Transcription Tool that can facilitate digitisation of hand-written manuscripts within a course assignment context.  Students are able to collaborate together to write and review transcribed manuscripts that can then be used to improve the accessibility of the original artifact or for text analysis. 

This open module can be added to any modern Learning Management Systems (LMS) through the Learning Tools Interoperability standard (LTI) which is supported by all modern LMS.
